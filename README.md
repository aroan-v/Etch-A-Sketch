# Etch-A-Sketch
This is a simple project from The Odin Project curriculum where I applied everything I learned from the previous lessons, while also independently exploring some concepts that haven't been taught yet.

## Applications Used
    - Visual Studio Code
    - Figma
    - Git and GitHub
    - codepen.io
    - Third party code

## Outcome
    - Manipulation of the DOM through javascript
    - Manipulation of data attributes
    - Creation of multiple functions with specific uses
    - Attachment of event listeners 
    - Toggling of CSS classes

## Other Explored Stuff through research
    - Generation of DIVs through CSS Grids
    - Application of Data attributes
    - CSS Designs, specifically the CSS grid and the toggling of classes
    - Usage of rem versus px 
    - Usage of in-built javascript methods and functions like setTimeout()
